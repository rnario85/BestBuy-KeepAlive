<h1><strong>BestBuy-KeepAlive</strong></h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>BestBuy-KeepAlive is a script based on <a href="https://github.com/kkapuria3/BestBuy-GPU-Bot">kkapuria3&rsquo;s BestBuy-GPU-Bot</a> that&rsquo;s been modified to simulate a purchase of an in stock item every set interval to maintain the validity of the Best Buy Verification Status. Best Buy often gives an extra step to manually enter a verification code that is sent via SMS in between Cart Page and the Final Checkout Page. After going through the verification step successfully, Best Buy doesn&rsquo;t seem to ask for it again for another 20-30 minutes. The only way to extend the verification validity is by going through the purchase process until you get to the Final Checkout Page. This script automates that process and clears your cart without completing the purchase.</p>
